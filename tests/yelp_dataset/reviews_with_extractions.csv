It had a great location just off Union Square, a nice pedigree and a litle quirkiness. We also liked its literary slant and the adjoining Cafe Andree next door (very nice pancakes and coffee for breakfast!)The bedroom was on the small side with crooked floors, but also bright - quite Parisien in feel.

2,2,Sep 17 2009 ,"Our group of nine adults gets together annually. Because this year was our 50th wedding anniversary, we got to pick the venue. Knowing how pictures can &quot;lie,&quot; I visited at least two dozen hotels around Union Square in San Francisco and was delighted that the Donatello was within our price range. The standard rooms are larger than any others in the nearby hotels--and the windows open, a real plus for me. From booking through checkout, service from everyone was friendly and efficient. The rooms are equipped with a microwave, fridge, and basic dishware. Friday afternoon wine and cheese was augumented during our stay with appetizers from a local restaurant; we had an enjoyable hour socializing with other guests. The free continental breakfast (which apparently was not everyone's favorite) has been replaced by a self-serve buffet ($7/person added to your bill) at the Zingari restaurant bar (accessible by hotel elevator). I'm unclear about the relationship between the restaurant and the hotel, but would recommend the restaurant as well. My husband and I have eaten there many times and never had less than good to excellent food and service. This time they were even willing to provide us with separate checks (a must at these reunions).We had rooms on the 8th, 9th, and 10th floors and had no complaints about noise. Our rooms faced Mason St.; rooms facing Post might be noisier. The hotel is in the center of a major city, after all, so it's not going to be as quiet as a wilderness.The hotel is a resort, but I asked that we not be given a sales pitch.

8,8,Oct 5 2008 ,"The Warwick is an older and smaller hotel. The rooms are nicely decorated and a good size compared to other hotel rooms in San Francisco. The only drawback is that there is no air conditioning system, but not a problem as long as you dont go during a heatwave. Our toilet leaked a bit, but we figured out that all we needed to do was jiggle the handle. the weahter forecast was left on the bed each noght with some chocolates during the turndown service which I considered to be a nice touch. Staff was friendly and courteous, always eager to answer a question or engage in conversation if you had the time. Price was great. Walgreens accross the street was super convenient. We tried finding cheaper parking in the area, but other garages seemed a bit shady, especially when you can smell alcohol on the attendents breath. So we decided to go with the valet parking at the hotel for $35 a day with in and out priveledges. The location was amazing. We were able to walk to the beginning of the cable car line at powell and market st in just a few minutes (5 blocks). I recommend starting there, otherwise you might get passed up at other cable car stops because there is simply no room for you. There is also a subway at that same intersection. Buy a muni pass!. you can use almost every kind of transportation at leisure for unlimited rides. there are other tour busses that charge an arm and a leg to drop you off at all the tourist spots. with a muni pass, all you need is a map of the city to see what lines you need to catch. Super convenient for out trips to fishermans wharf and the ball park. We skipped the transportation for our trips to Yerba Buena Gardens, union square and chinatown.

The hotel was very clean, rooms were of average size but had everything you needed in them and the hotel staff were extremely helpful and always willing to please. As we were always out sightseeing or visiting various bars or restaurants we spent little time in our rooms to be affected by any noise. There isnt a restaurant in the hotel but who wants to eat hotel food when there are so many cafes, restaurants and bars around? A small shop opened whilst we were there where you could get croissants, coffee etc if you didnt want to look around for food. I would definitely recommend this hotel for its location, cleanliness and value for money.

Here is my humble opinion: - Valet: Ticket says &quot;call 20 min before you need your car&quot; - Most days it took 45 min to 1 hour to get the car. - Room: Felt like a jail cell. Tiny windows, Twin beds, no space for 2 people at all. Smallest room I have ever seen in my travel life. No AC. - Bathroom: Decent size considering the size of the room. - Safe: Could not get it to work in both rooms we booked. - Breakfast: Bread, Muffins, OJ and Coffee. Need to take back to room to eat ... oh wait ... there is no desk in the room ... need to eat on the bed ... - Location: Excellent- Staff: Very, very friendly. - Service: Very good. Room was impecable every time I got back to the hotel. - Cleanliness: Excellent - Value: Too expensive for the lack of comfort in the rooms. - Noise: Club downstairs ... up till 2am listening to the music. - Overall: Would not stay there again unless if it is a bargain ...",Tiny Little Rooms,usa_san francisco_hotel_fusion,"[{'entity': 'windows', 'predicate': 'Tiny', 'negation': False, 'attribute': 'room -> size', 'review_id': 17, 'phrase': 'Tiny windows', 'sentiment': 0.0}, {'entity': 'room', 'predicate': 'Smallest', 'negation': False, 'attribute': 'room -> size', 'review_id': 17, 'phrase': 'Smallest room', 'sentiment': 0.0}, {'entity': 'size', 'predicate': 'Decent', 'negation': False, 'attribute': 'room -> size', 'review_id': 17, 'phrase': 'Decent size', 'sentiment': 0.0}, {'entity': 'Room', 'predicate': 'impecable', 'negation': False, 'attribute': 'room -> cleanliness', 'review_id': 17, 'phrase': 'impecable Room', 'sentiment': 0.0}, {'entity': 'Value', 'predicate': 'Excellent', 'negation': False, 'attribute': 'value', 'review_id': 17, 'phrase': 'Excellent Value', 'sentiment': 0.7269}, {'entity': 'comfort', 'predicate': 'lack', 'negation': False, 'attribute': 'general', 'review_id': 17, 'phrase': 'lack comfort', 'sentiment': 0.0516}, {'entity': 'comfort', 'predicate': 'Too expensive', 'negation': False, 'attribute': 'value', 'review_id': 17, 'phrase': 'Too expensive comfort', 'sentiment': 0.3612}]",tripadvisor_review_12660,0.9556,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007371428571428571,0.002457142857142857,17,949.0,227.0,15.0,"{""room"": 0.3281601476708469, ""need"": 0.25038917754430734, ""min"": 0.210452996031276, ""excellent"": 0.18499140482178228, ""eat"": 0.18499140482178228}","{""work rooms"": 0.10403028687851616, ""windows twin"": 0.10403028687851616, ""wait desk"": 0.10403028687851616, ""value expensive"": 0.10403028687851616, ""valet ticket"": 0.10403028687851616}"
18,18,Jun 25 2009 ,"This was my third or fourth visit to the White Swan Inn. It is a great place to use as home base while you are exploring San Francisco. The rooms are comfortable and generously sized, the full breakfast buffet delicious, and little touches like wine and snacks at 5 p.m., tea at all hours, and freshly made cookies in the lobby cookie jar always make my stay enjoyable. I also enjoy being able to walk to Union Square, Chinatown, and even North Beach.
