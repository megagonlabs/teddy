From our arrival and check-in, to check-out, service was faultless and facilities were wonderful. We got a 2 bedroom apartment, with 2 bathrooms, and a fully equipped kitchen. All appliances were state of the art, and our room also had a Bosch washer and a separate dryer, which was really helpful. The apartment itself was very spacious, with large windows, automatic blinds, 3 large high-def LCD screens, cable TV with 100's of channels, DVD players - as well as a gas heater in the living area! We loved it so much we wished that we lived at Fairmong Heritage Place Ghirardelli Square. Also downstairs, there are 3 or 4 Ghirardelli chocolate cafe's and shops, which were fantastic. There are several restaurants as well as specialty shops at the Square, and it's only a short walk from the Fisherman's Wharf itself. Staff were fantastic, with the concierge doing everything he could to accommodate to our requests, from in-room dining, to arranging a in-residence masseuse for my wife. The Maserati town car was absolutely fantastic as well, as it took us to Union Square, shopping areas, or other restaurants that are a just a bit too far to walk to. There's a guest lounge area as well, with a high quality pool table and daily breakfast in the morning. We loved it, and so will you.", "summary": "Fantastic stay - the best we ever had", "business_id": "usa_san francisco_fairmont_heritage_place_ghirardelli_square", "extractions": [{"entity": "appliances", "predicate": "state of", "negation": false, "attribute": "operation"}, {"entity": "room", "predicate": "state of", "negation": false, "attribute": "room -> cleanliness"}, {"entity": "washer", "predicate": "state of", "negation": false, "attribute": "room -> bathroom"}, {"entity": "separate", "predicate": "state of", "negation": false, "attribute": "location"}, {"entity": "chocolate cafe", "predicate": "fantastic", "negation": false, "attribute": "food"}, {"entity": "shops", "predicate": "fantastic", "negation": false, "attribute": "location"}, {"entity": "restaurants", "predicate": "several", "negation": false, "attribute": "location"}, {"entity": "Fisherman", "predicate": "short walk from", "negation": false, "attribute": "location"}, {"entity": "specialty shops", "predicate": "several", "negation": false, "attribute": "location"}, {"entity": "Maserati", "predicate": "absolutely fantastic", "negation": false, "attribute": "building"}, {"entity": "town car", "predicate": "absolutely fantastic", "negation": false, "attribute": "general"}, {"entity": "Union Square", "predicate": "a bit too far", "negation": false, "attribute": "location"}, {"entity": "shopping areas", "predicate": "a bit too far", "negation": false, "attribute": "location"}, {"entity": "restaurants", "predicate": "a bit too far", "negation": false, "attribute": "location"}]}, {"review_id": "tripadvisor_review_1", "date": "Nov 1 2009 ", "text": "Unsold timeshares being rented by the night at this point. Best points: HUGE space (12' ceilings, full dining room, well-stocked kitchen including wine cooler and dishwasher, living room with fireplace, huge terrace, enormous marble &amp; glass bath and ample bedroom, Bosch washer/dryer). Stylish decor and lighting. Nice staff, albeit young and not always practiced. Very convenient location - next door to Gary Danko, walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf and cable cars, right on bus line (N. Point St.) to GG Park. Could be better: not exactly soundproof, as evidenced by the small child upstairs (who lets a little kid stay up until 1AM?). If you want a foam pillow or other housekeeping service, ask them directly (seems to be a communications gap with the friendly kids at the front desk). If you pay the hefty extra for a &quot;bay view&quot; room, be sure to get the 3rd or 4th floor - otherwise, your bay &quot;view&quot; is between the other buildings in Ghirardelli Square (and the people in those buildings look right back into your bedroom). Overall, not really a Fairmont but still a great place for a break, especially if you prefer self-catering.", "summary": "Splurge for convenience and space", "business_id": "usa_san francisco_fairmont_heritage_place_ghirardelli_square", "extractions": [{"entity": "timeshares", "predicate": "Unsold", "negation": false, "attribute": "value"}, {"entity": "decor", "predicate": "Stylish", "negation": false, "attribute": "building"}, {"entity": "lighting", "predicate": "Stylish", "negation": false, "attribute": "room -> interior"}, {"entity": "staff", "predicate": "Nice", "negation": false, "attribute": "staff"}, {"entity": "staff", "predicate": "young", "negation": false, "attribute": "staff"}, {"entity": "staff", "predicate": "not always practiced", "negation": false, "attribute": "staff"}, {"entity": "location", "predicate": "Very convenient", "negation": false, "attribute": "location"}, {"entity": "location", "predicate": "next door", "negation": false, "attribute": "location"}, {"entity": "Fisherman 's Wharf", "predicate": "walking distance", "negation": false, "attribute": "location"}, {"entity": "bus line", "predicate": "right on", "negation": false, "attribute": "location"}, {"entity": "cable cars", "predicate": "walking distance", "negation": false, "attribute": "location"}]}]
